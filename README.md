Baumkataster-Graz
=================

Based on data provided via [data.graz.gv.at](http://data.graz.gv.at), [refined](https://github.com/species/OGD-Graz-Daten/tree/master/Baumkataster) by [Michael maier (species)](https://github.com/species).

Split into GeoJSON data tiles and displayed using Leaflet and [TileLayer.GeoJSON](https://github.com/glenrobertson/leaflet-tilelayer-geojson/). (Inspired by [Norbert Renner (ikonor)'s](https://github.com/nrenner) talk [*“DIY OSM vector tiles”*](http://www.slideshare.net/OSMFstateofthemap/diy-osm-pbf-vector-tiles-state-of-the-map-2013).)
